# PureToneAudiogram
A MATLAB script for conducting automated hearing test using pure tones. 
The script outputs Pure Tone Audiogram plots along with log file, results tabulation file.  

Please note, I do not have artificial ear and sound level meter equipment to calibrate the intensities used in this test. 
However, I hope this script will provide a good estimate of actual hearing level in just under 5 mins.  

This can be useful to know if the subject suffers hearing loss at the frequencies used in the experiment.
